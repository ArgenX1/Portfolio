# Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio example displaying my HTML and CSS abilities so far.
This project has further enhanced my understanding of CSS and HTML, it also really pushed my knowledge of them.
It was a hard project for sure but I'm happy I did it!

## Usage

The page is a get to know me and my work page, clicking the pictures of my projects will take you to said project.

## Credits

I'd like to thank my study group for helping me out with the flex boxes and screen re-sizing when I was having a hard time understanding those concepts.
